Please note that this script assumes you have a valid private key or wallet JSON file for the sending address, and that you have sufficient ETH in that address to cover the transactions. Make sure to replace 'your-private-key' with your actual private key or specify the correct path to your wallet JSON file.

Also, replace 'address1', 'address2', 'address3' with the actual recipient addresses you want to send ETH to, and adjust the amount variable as needed.

Please exercise caution when working with cryptocurrencies and ensure that you have a good understanding of the risks involved.
